The Multi-PDF's Chat Agent is a Streamlit-based web application designed to facilitate interactive conversations with a chatbot. The app allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, extract text information from them, and train a chatbot using this extracted content. Users can then engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot.

- ### Challenges
